# FedRAMP Control to Cross-Framework Mapping
# Maps NIST 800-53 Rev 5 control families to equivalent controls in other frameworks.
# Used to identify reusable evidence from existing SOC 2, ISO 27001, or HIPAA compliance.

cross_framework_mappings:

  AC:  # Access Control
    soc2_criteria: ["CC6.1", "CC6.2", "CC6.3"]

    cis_controls: ["5", "6"]
    overlap_percentage: 75
    notes: "SOC 2 CC6 maps well. FedRAMP adds PIV/CAC and specific parameter values."

    hipaa_safeguards: ["164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)"]
    cis_controls: ["7"]
    overlap_percentage: 55
    notes: "FedRAMP requires specific vuln scanning cadence and tool requirements."
