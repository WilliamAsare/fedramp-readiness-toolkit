# Custom Inheritance Overrides
#
# Use this file to override default inheritance classifications when your
# deployment differs from the typical SaaS-on-IaaS pattern.
#
# Common reasons to override:
# - You use a managed PaaS service that handles more than typical IaaS
# - You've implemented something differently than the default assumes
# - Your 3PAO has a specific interpretation you need to follow
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/inheritance_mapper.py --baseline moderate --provider aws --custom-overrides overrides.yaml

overrides:
  # Example: We use AWS Fargate (serverless containers), so we inherit more
  # configuration management from AWS than a typical EC2 deployment
  CM-6: inherited    # AWS manages container host configurations
  CM-7: inherited    # Least functionality handled at container platform level

  # Example: We use a managed database (RDS) with automated backups,
  # so backup controls are more inherited than shared
  CP-9: inherited    # RDS automated backups with point-in-time recovery

  # Example: Our 3PAO considers wireless access completely N/A for
  # a cloud-only SaaS, not just inherited
  AC-18: na          # No wireless infrastructure exists
